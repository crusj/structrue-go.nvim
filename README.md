# structrue-go.nvim
A better structured display of golang symbol information

## Description
I use some plugins that reflect the file struct, they support many languages, but they can't be implemented well in golang, especially in struct and method. Because if a struct has many methods and you don't want the file to be too large,  the struct and the methods belonging to it can be in different files. I hope to create a plugin like goland structure that can show or hide the methods in the structure that are not in the current file.

The project is not yet completed, the description will be updated when it is completed
